    <h2>How tagging works</h2>
    <p>
      The Explorer relies on community tagging to function. Every episode is connected to one or more
      <strong>Periods</strong>, <strong>Regions</strong>, <strong>Topics</strong>, and sometimes a <strong>Series</strong>.
      These tags power all filters, charts, groupings and statistics across the site.
    </p>
    <p>
      To keep the dataset consistent, the tagging sheet uses locked columns and controlled dropdown lists.
      This ensures that values remain uniform — no duplicate spellings, variants or accidental new categories.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="content-block">
    <h3>Period, Region & Topic</h3>
    <p>
      These fields use <strong>pre-defined multi-select dropdowns</strong>.
      You may select one or several values, but you <strong>cannot</strong> create new ones.
    </p>
    <p>
      This prevents inconsistent tagging, such as:
      <br>• “Early Medieval” vs “Early-Medieval”
      <br>• “Middle East” vs “ME”
      <br>• “America” vs “The Americas”
    </p>
    <p>
      Valid values are maintained centrally to keep filtering predictable and clean.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="content-block">
    <h3>Series</h3>
    <p>
      The Series field is <strong>auto-suggested</strong> based on the episode title,
      but you may freely edit or correct it.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is the <strong>only</strong> column that allows free text.  
      All others are locked to protect the dataset from accidental edits.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="content-block">
    <h3>Locked columns</h3>
    <p>
      Titles, descriptions, dates, episode IDs and all technical metadata are imported automatically
      from the public RSS feed and are <strong>locked</strong> for editing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Only the tag fields described above are editable.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="content-block">
    <h2>Access & contributions</h2>
    <p>
      The tagging sheet is <strong>read-only by default</strong>.
      To help maintain quality, editing is restricted to approved contributors.
    </p>

  <section class="content-block">
    <h3>Contribution philosophy</h3>
    <p>
      Tagging is collaborative. If you see something that looks incorrect, feel free to fix it —
      changes are tracked and several contributors help keep everything tidy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The goal isn’t to create “perfect historical categorisation”, but a consistent structure
      that makes the Episode Explorer more useful to everyone.

      Categories and tag data are based on a Google Sheet used by TRIH fans.
      This Explorer builds on the great work of Dan’s original categorisation (known on X as @Dan_YIMBY),
      now opening the tagging to the whole TRIH community.
